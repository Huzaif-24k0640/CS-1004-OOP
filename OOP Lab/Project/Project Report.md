1.	Executive Summary 
•	Overview: Developed a C++ restaurant management system. Implemented OOP concepts: encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism. Designed basic GUI for user interaction. Used file handling for persistent storage
•	Key Findings: Successfully managed orders, menu, and billing. Demonstrated practical application of OOP. GUI improved user accessibility and interaction  Introduction 
•	Background: Many small restaurants lack an affordable digital system. C++ is a powerful tool for demonstrating OOP concepts in realworld problems. This project applies OOP principles in a practical management system
•	Project Objectives: 
1.	Create a functional restaurant management system  
2.	 Integrate GUI with backend logic  
3.	 Utilize file handling instead of databases  
4.	 Apply all four core OOP principles



2.	Project Description 
•	Scope:
1.	Menu management  
2.	Order processing and billing  
3.	Customer information handling  
4.	GUI and filebased storage

•	Technical Overview: 
1.	C++ 
2.	IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio  
3.	GUI Library: RayLib
4.	File I/O for storing menu and order data  

3.	Methodology 
•	Approach: 
1.	Weekly planning and division of tasks  
2.	 Step by step development: design, implementation, testing  
•	Roles and Responsibilities: 
	Hardeep: GUI Module.
	Huzaif: Filing Module.
	Kazim: OOP Concepts and Integrator
4.	Project Implementation 
•	Design and Structure: 
1.	 GUI based system using Raylib library.
2.	 Structured with modular classes like:
3.	 Login Form, Menu, Fast Food, Desi Menu.
4.	 Food specific subclasses: burger, pizza, Roll, Biryani, Karahi, Handi.
5.	 Order Page manages order quantity and billing interface.
6.	 Separation of concerns between login system, food selection, and order handling.
•	Functionalities Developed: 
•	Login/Signup Interface: Toggle between login and signup tabs. Input fields for username and password using InputField struct.
•	Menu Navigation: Selection between Fast Food and Desi Food.
•	Fast Food Section: Suboptions: Burger, Pizza, Sandwich, Roll, Ice Cream. Each option opens detailed food lists.
•	Desi Food Section: Suboptions: Karahi, Biryani, BBQ, Handi, Ice Cream.
•	Order Handling: Clicking food item sets price. Users can increase/decrease quantity. Dynamic total price calculation. GUI includes address input, price display, and order button.
•	Visual Enhancements: Use of gradients and background images for better GUI aesthetics.
•	Challenges Faced: 
•	GUI Management: Integrating multiple menus and back navigation. Dynamically rendering and switching interfaces.
•	Input Handling: Managing different user inputs for login and food orders.
•		Code Modularity: Structuring the project with a high number of interlinked classes.
•	Solutions: Used inheritance for food item pages.
5.	Results 
•	Project Outcomes 
	Complete GUI based restaurant system.
	Real time order handling and pricing system.
	Login system with registration flow.
	Core OOP concepts implemented: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
•	Screenshots and Illustrations: 
 
 
 
•	Testing and Validation: 
1.	Manual testing for all food categories.
2.	Test all buttons, interactions, and navigation paths.
3.	Input handling tests.
 
•	Summary of Findings: 
	Developed a well structured GUI.
	Demonstrated core OOP concepts effectively.
	Practical implementation of Filing.

•	Final Remarks: 
•	The project can be expanded with file/database storage and real customer profiles.
•	Served as strong practice for GUI, Filing,and class based architecture in C++.
